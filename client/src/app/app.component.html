    STUDY NOTES - NG entry point for all your routing configurations 
    - Additional Notes in nav.component.html
    - This is the app's entry point. 
    - The app.component elements are used for the the SPA architecture, all the components are supposed to be here. 
    - The .ts of the app component has the main services we are going to be implementing
    - The app.module.ts is the root component and it has all the packages, imports, etc that we are going to be using throughout the application
    - You invoke the components using the <>/<> tag, it should provide the available components when you open the statement 
        i.e. <app-nav></app-nav>


    STUDY NOTES - Routing 
        1. <router-outlet></router-outlet> can replace the <app-home></app-home> 
        2. Because in the routing, th default is the home component in app-routing.module.ts 
        3. Thus, it is working as expected 
        4.  //Empty route that routes back to the home page => https://localhost:4200/
            {path: '', component: HomeComponent},


    STUDY NOTES - ngx-spinner (1)
        1. Entry point to our spinner application, as this is our route component, visible accross the entire application. 
        2. As its global, we are initializing it at the beggining of everything, to affect all aspects of our application 
        3. Next notes are on "busy.services.ts" AND THEN "loading.interceptor.ts"
        4. The implementation of the spinner itself is very well detailed on the page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-spinner
        5. Technically you only need to set your information about the spinner here. But, as we are using the same spinner throughout, we want to be 
        as descriptive as possible. Thus, It wont hurt to initialize the elements that we are using in the spinner throughout.
